# MyQUAD
First Open Source Arduino Based Quad Copter

Back in the day, gaining access to a Quad Copter wasn't easy.  Especially one that you could intimately know and modify.  I set out to change that.

I wanted to develop a platform that "students" could come to know and understand.  My hope was to inspire students from all walks of life to learn and grow.  I hope I did that with the material in this repository.  After I developed this material, I handed it over to others who promised to make it all publically available.  I'm not convenced that they did a very good job of that.  So, I've placed the materials here in this repository for public consumption.  (Albeit, SEVEN YEARS LATER!)

At the time, I chose to develop the Quad Copter on an Arduino board.  I had already gotten many people, mostly students, excited about the Arduino board with Introductory Training materials that I had created on my own previously.  I knew that the Arduino platform would be easy for NOOBs to wrap thier brain around and get them hooked.  So I designed a Quad Copter Shield and set off to develop a complete kit.  I purposely designed the Shield in Eagle to enable others to modify or embellish via a free tool.

I looked around for a long time to try and find some code that would work on my new platform.  Though there were code options to be had, most of them required a PhD in Computer Programming to debug if you changed the slightest thing.  I knew this would be a buz kill for my following ... so I personally wrote all of the code from scratch in the Programming language.  This code is also included in the attached material, and I hope you find use in opening it up and playing around with it.

The course is meant to be a week long course; four days of lecture and building, one final day for debugging, code upgrading, and a fly-off contest.  So in a week you should be able to go from total NOOB to a flying platform, over 1500 other students have done so themselves.

Good luck, and have some fun with this!
